To many observers bitcoin\u2019s current market cycle is not complete, as no solid peak had formed, and speculators still expect another bubble to come to fruition. Many digital currency traders pay attention to tops and bottoms and the four stages of the market cycle. The stages include the accumulation phase, the uptrend phase, the distribution phase, and the downtrend or capitulation phase. One could say that the accumulation phase took place 666 days ago on March 12, 2020, when the price of bitcoin slipped below the $4K per unit zone.
