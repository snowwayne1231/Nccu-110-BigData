    "content": "U.S. inflation is red hot and a number of analysts and economists are predicting America will face further economic issues as politicians and the Biden administration blame corporations. This perspective on rising inflation has led finance authors like Isabella Weber to believe that price controls could ease America\u2019s economic burdens. America is dealing with the worst inflation in over four decades and the White House thinks that tougher anti-monopoly policy could fix the situation. Furthermore, a few congressional leaders want to stifle online ecommerce giants like Amazon with proposals like Senator Amy Klobuchar\u2019s (D-Minn.) American Innovation and Online Competition Act. Senator Tom Cotton\u2019s (R-Ark.) Platform Competition and Opportunity Act (PCOA) is also aimed at reforming anti-trust laws. The White House is blaming the loss of purchasing power in America on monopolistic behavior. Last month, the White House shared data that claimed four corporate entities in the meat-processing industry have been fueling inflation. NYU professor Marion Nestle told the New York Times in an interview that \u201ctheir goal is to control the market so that they can control the price.\u201d Despite the opinion from Biden\u2019s administration, the North American Meat Institute says the claims are false."

Today, bitcoiners and cryptocurrency advocates worldwide are celebrating the 13th anniversary of the Bitcoin network\u2019s launch. On this day, 13 years ago, Bitcoin\u2019s inventor Satoshi Nakamoto launched the genesis block, otherwise known as \u201cblock zero.\u201d There are several unique characteristics of the genesis block that make it different than the blocks that followed. For instance, the genesis block has a 50 BTC block reward subsidy that can never be spent. Block zero also has two more leading hex zeroes in the hash which was common for bitcoin blocks mined in the early days. The genesis block also contains a special message stored in the coinbase parameter. The message derives from a London Times January 3, 2009 headline and reads:"

Cammesa, the state-owned power wholesaler, has sent a memo to big power consumers to reveal whether they are mining cryptocurrency. If so, the companies should reveal their actual power consumption so a price hike can be coordinated, and they will need to invest in power infrastructure. The Argentinian government is trying to pinpoint the exact power usage that bitcoin miners require from the national power grid, in order to take measures to improve the current power crisis the country is facing. Cammesa, the state-owned energy wholesaler, has sent a letter to all registered large-scale consumers, requesting they report the energy consumption of possible mining operations they may host, including the power consumed by what the company calls the \u201cserver group,\u201d the refrigeration equipment to cool the miners, and other associated equipment. According to local media reports, the Argentinian government \u2014 via the Undersecretary of Electric Energy \u2014 could be planning to take action to get miners to pay more for this energy, launching a new tariff scheme and making cryptocurrency miners invest in the power system directly. This with the objecting of relieving the stress these operations are said to be causing the national grid, which in some cases has faced power cuts affecting more than 80,000 citizens and provoking protests."
